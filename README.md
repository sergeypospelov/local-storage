# Local kv-storage bits

## Compilation instructions
1. Download protobuf https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.18.1 and put it into ./protobuf-3.18.1
2. Run ```make kv```
3. Run ```make all```

## Protocol description
* Each client uses a single tcp socket for communication with the server
* All messages have the following form: message_type (1 byte) message_len (4 bytes) message_data (message_len bytes)
* message_data is the serialized form for one of the messages described in `kv.proto`
* Each request and each response message contains a request_id field used to match responses vs requests

## Run instructions
* Start the server @ port 4242: `./server 4242`
* Run put + get stages with 100 requests via the client: `./client 4242 100 put get`
* Run only the get stage via the client: `./client 4242 100 get`
* Run put + get stages with debug-level logging via the client: `VERBOSITY=4 ./client 4242 100 put get`

See the code for more details

## TODO
0. Implement a simple_client that would be used to send single requests, specified via cmdline parameters
1. The hash table used in the server should be persistent (right now it's just an ordinary std::unordered_map)
2. After making this hash table persistent, implement a persistent key-value storage based on this hash index
